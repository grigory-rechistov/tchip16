== tchip16 ==

Windows: `tchip16 <source> [-o dest] [-m] [-a] [-z]`

Linux: `./tchip16 <source> [-o dest] [-m] [-a] [-z]` 

(< >:required, [ ]:optional)

  * compiles file(s) _source_
  * output file is _dest_ if -o is specified, _output.c16_ otherwise
  * if -m is specified, outputs _mmap.txt_ which lists the addresses of all the labels in the code
  * if -a is specified, aligns labels and pads db's to 4-byte boundaries
  * if -z is specified, fill the output file with 0's after code until 64K

== img_conv ==

Windows: `img_conv <source> <dest> [col_key]`

  * reads _source_ and outputs corresponding _dest_
  * if _col`_`key_ is specified, all pixels of color _col`_`key_ will be transparent

*Remember*: _source_ must be a 24-bit BMP file.

= FAQ =

== What is tchip16? What should I use it for? ==

_tchip16_ is an assembler for the Chip16 VM, which is detailed in the [http://forums.ngemu.com/web-development-programming/138170-codename-chip16-prev-chip9.html thread] on Emuforums.
You should use it to compile your code into a Chip16 binary file.

== Is tchip16 available for my system? ==

_tchip16_ is cross-platform, in the sense that it does not include platform-specific code, and should build without problems on linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.
That said, it was developed on Windows, so _only Windows (x86, 32-bit) binaries are available_ -- for other systems, you will have to compile from source.
